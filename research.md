Principles of organization:

- Projects based (+ easy to list, - difficult overview)
  - project
  - my contribution
  - my publication
  - my working papers
- Research object based, like mivich (+ serious, easy to overview. - difficult to list because res obj hard question)
  - Object
    - The formation and the transformation of disciplines
    - Social mobility
    - Social stratification in education
    - Life course, career
    - mapping pathways
    - prosopography (db share)
  - Projects (if any)
  - Publications
- Research domains, like Gingras publications list (+ another easy to overview, - less informative than object based)
  - Domain
  - Project
  - Publications

Solution: do it by object or domain, but by all means begin with actual projects, papers and stuff. Like Bruch project, what is the object there? decision-making processes in social contexts, aspirations

new insight: no more than 4 headings, seasoned researchers rarely have more, so having 8-15 would be ridiculous.
