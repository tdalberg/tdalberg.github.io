The first time I read [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915006117 "Measuring the predictability of life outcomes with a scientific mass collaboration"), reporting on a massive collaboration of hundreds of scientists focused on the common task of predicting life outcomes using a single, common dataset, I thought it was an elaborate April fools. There was something about the way the abstract was phrased that immediately made me think "not only is this ridiculous, but it's ridiculous in a way that's not even fun". It didn't help that the link was posted the to me on April 1st, or that the paper too conveniently was published online March 30. Even recognized some of the names among the long list of authors, all I could think of was "OK, they are part of this massive joke. I get it now, you got me. I guess it was kind of fun". But then when the ones who posted the link started talking about the paper as the real deal, I realized that I was in the wrong - this was no joke. Which is good, because I believe social science (and humanities) could do with more of these massive collaborations focused on clearly defined problems to establish, once and for a long time, what should count as the current state of the art on a phenomenon. So, instead of a disdainful giggle, I felt excitement; I would definitely read this (sometime after finishing the grant application, and that paper, and that other thing).

Now that I have finally had time to read it, I must confess it was a bit of a disappointment. 

- Describe what they are doing. LIke predicting outcomes based on data. only seeing data up to a point, last update being held out. Cool set up. But, predictions are single variables. It is not clear to me what social theory is informing these predictions. To be harsh, it seems to be more in the vain of clear positivist empiricism than discursive rationalism, to borrow from the writings of Gaston Bachelard.
- Then use the Gingrasian discussion about physics (with wink-wink to email thread)
